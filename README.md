Calculator Vault respects user privacy. The app does not collect, store, or share any personal data with external servers.
All photos, videos, and files hidden using the app remain **locally on the user’s device** and are protected using secure authentication (PIN/password). No cloud storage or data syncing is used.
The app only requests permissions required for core functionality, such as accessing device storage to hide and restore user-selected files.
Users have full control over their data and can delete all hidden content at any time. Uninstalling the app removes all app data from the device.
